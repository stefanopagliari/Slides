# Political Business Cycles

---

## Nordhaus: “The Political Business Cycle”(1975)

--

### Assumptions of Nordhaus' Political Business Cycle

+ **Myopic voters** reward past economic performance, while while not seeing the long-term effects of policy 
+ **Politicians** as self-interested actors seeking re-election
+ **Phillips Curve:** Macro-economic theory that posits a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment

--
### Nordhaus' Political Business Cycle: the Model
+ **Near election time**, governments have incentives to pump up the economy to reduce unemployment
+ **After the election**, politicians shift to contractionary policy to combat inflation
+ **Result:** suboptimal economic performance

### Nordhaus' Political Business Cycle: the Evidence

+ Weak (but not wholly absent) evidence of electoral cycles in macroeconomic outcomes (Alesina et al. 1992; Alesina & Rosenthal 1995).

--
### Tufte (1978): "The Political Control of the Economy" - The Argument

+ Government will deliver **timed** and **clearly attributable** benefits to key voters before elections
	+ **direct transfers** (e.g., social security, veterans’ benefits, or other direct payments),
	+ **tax cuts** or delayed hikes,
	+ **spending increases** or delayed cuts,
	+ public **hiring** or delayed firing.

--
### Evidence

+ More evidence of cycles in direct transfers and other economic policies than in macroeconomic outcomes
+ Incumbents more prone to manipulate the timing of policy implementation than policies themselves.

--
###  Timing of Elections

- Incumbents likely to schedule elections to coincide with economic expansions

## What influences political business cycles?

+ **Voters’ rational expectations**
	+ Voters can foresee the policymakers' incentives
	+ Smaller and less regular electoral cycles 
+ **External constraints** on policymakers
	+ Independence of central bank limit the capacity of government to manipulate monetary policy
+ **Number of parties in government**
	+ When government is divided across different parties, target of economic responsibility is less clear to voters
